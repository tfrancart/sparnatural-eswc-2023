## Summary
{:#conclusion}

Sparnatural offers an easy way to leverage knowledge graphs. Users with no technical knowledge of SPARQL and no _a priori_ knowledge of the graph structure can query the data. Its client-side only deployment allows to easily include it in a webpage, replacing or complementing existing SPARQL endpoint forms.

Future work on Sparnatural includes addition of geographical and numerical search widgets; and on the configuration side, the ability to automatically derive a configuration ontology from the underlying graph structure, that can be manually tuned to be presented to end-users. SHACL-based configuration is also considered.
