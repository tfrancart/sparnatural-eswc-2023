## Introduction
{:#introduction}

The requirement for data interoperability has driven the development of conceptual models used for structuring knowledge graphs, like [CIDOC-CRM](cite:cites cidoccrm) for cultural heritage, [LRM](cite:cites lrm) for libraries, or [RIC-O](cite:cites ric-o) for archives. Knowledge graphs based on these ontologies are accessible either using a developer-oriented service (SPARQL endpoint), or sometimes they underly other search systems, typically multicriteria query forms or faceted search engines.

Data interoperability and data aggregation from silos in a homogeneous graph require a lot of effort, at the intellectual, business process and technical levels. These efforts are hard to demonstrate, because no good solution exists to make the graph *tangible* for managers and *accessible* for end-users: SPARQL endpoints are too technical, and search systems don't make the underlying graph tangible.
