## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Knowledge Graphs are often relying on conceptual models with a high level of abstraction, making them hard to understand for nonexpert users, and are often hidden behind search forms, losing the flexibility to interact with the graph *as a graph*.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to leverage knowledge graphs there is a need to propose end-user oriented interactions demonstrating how they can allow to discover a knowledge domain.
<!-- Task         -->
Sparnatural was designed and developed as a visual, configurable, easily deployable, open-source, client-side SPARQL query builder, allowing users to query any RDF knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
We describe here how Sparnatural works, how it can be configured, and we show how it was deployed in two demonstrators for the *Archives Nationales de France* and *Biblioth√®que Nationale de France*.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show how Sparnatural has made it possible to give access to nonexpert users, with little effort, to these two large graphs.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Workshops conducted with end-users showed they were enthusiastic about the possibility offered. They also revealed that this novel search paradigm is surprising and could benefit from user onboarding.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The configuration of Sparnatural is key in providing efficient access to the graph, and can be done through the specification of a search-oriented ontology.
